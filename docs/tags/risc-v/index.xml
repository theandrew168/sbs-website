It seems as though more and more people are feeling and observing bloat and bugginess in their day-to-day usage of computers. In many situations, the mediocrity of today&amp;rsquo;s technology has become so common that it isn&amp;rsquo;t even seen as an issue.
During my few years spent in industry, these sort of quotes were heard almost daily:</description></item><item><title>Bare-Metal Assembly on the Longan Nano</title><link>https://shallowbrooksoftware.com/posts/bare-metal-assembly-on-the-longan-nano/</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shallowbrooksoftware.com/posts/bare-metal-assembly-on-the-longan-nano/</guid><description>The Sipeed Longan Nano is a small, affordable, 32-bit RISC-V chip. Despite its minimalism, the Longan Nano provides enough power and peripherals to learn RISC-V assembly and build exciting programs along the way.
The Longan Nano comes with the following components:
GigaDevice GD32VF103[CBT6] 32-bit CPU 8 MHz default clock speed (IRC8M) 108 MHz maximum clock speed 128 KB flash storage 32 KB sram memory 3 LEDs (red, green, and blue) 1 USB Type-C port 1 microSD card slot 160x80 pixel LCD (0.</description></item></channel></rss>
