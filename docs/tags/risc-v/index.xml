      <description>The Sipeed Longan Nano is a small, affordable, 32-bit RISC-V chip. Despite its minimalism, the Longan Nano provides enough power and peripherals to learn RISC-V assembly and build exciting programs along the way.
The Longan Nano comes with the following components:
 GigaDevice GD32VF103[CBT6] 32-bit CPU 8 MHz default clock speed (IRC8M) 108 MHz maximum clock speed 128 KB flash storage 32 KB sram memory 3 LEDs (red, green, and blue) 1 USB Type-C port 1 microSD card slot 160x80 pixel LCD (0.</description>
