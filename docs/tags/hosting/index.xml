It&amp;rsquo;s already 2025 and I only came across &lt;a href="https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/11653" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this PR&lt;/a> a few weeks ago.
That being said, it was merged in 2024 and I can&amp;rsquo;t recall seeing any other PRs from last year that had me stomping and hollering so hard.
Finding this feature (and the PR) came at a time of frustration: realizing that I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be able to use &lt;a href="https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/latest/systemd.socket.html" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">systemd socket activation&lt;/a> for &lt;a href="https://nextjs.org/" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NextJS&lt;/a> (or &lt;a href="https://remix.run/" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RemixJS&lt;/a>, for that matter) without having to jump through hoops.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Deploying Multi-File Web Applications</title><link>https://shallowbrooksoftware.com/posts/deploying-multi-file-web-applications/</link><pubDate>Sat, 10 May 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shallowbrooksoftware.com/posts/deploying-multi-file-web-applications/</guid><description>&lt;p>For quite a long time, I&amp;rsquo;ve had a question: what is the best way to deploy multi-file web applications?
When I say &amp;ldquo;multi-file&amp;rdquo;, I mean any application that doesn&amp;rsquo;t easily build into a single binary.
In general, web apps have many files to worry about: HTML templates, static assets, migrations, etc.
For ecosystems where the build output contains multiple directories and files, how we can safely deploy a new version of the app without any disruptions?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>My Current Opinions on Hosting Web Apps</title><link>https://shallowbrooksoftware.com/posts/my-current-opinions-on-hosting-web-apps/</link><pubDate>Sun, 18 Feb 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shallowbrooksoftware.com/posts/my-current-opinions-on-hosting-web-apps/</guid><description>&lt;p>A little while back, I was chatting with some tech friends about my experience using &lt;a href="https://fly.io/" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fly&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://neon.tech/" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Neon&lt;/a> for hosting web apps that are under active development.
Between these two services and their low pricing for small projects, my total bill for the month was only $0.01 (Fly doesn&amp;rsquo;t even collect invoices below $5.00).
I shared how Fly and Neon seemed like a great fit for projects that are a work in progress but that I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if I&amp;rsquo;d use them for production services.
I&amp;rsquo;d have to do more pricing estimations and stability testing before having the trust and confidence needed to rely on these tools for anything that had users or was generating income.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
