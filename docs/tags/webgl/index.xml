That post (which was only my second ever) was actually a response to &lt;em>another&lt;/em> &lt;a href="https://nullprogram.com/blog/2015/06/06/" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blog post&lt;/a> written by Chris Wellons (aka &lt;a href="https://nullprogram.com/" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">null program&lt;/a>) on the same topic.
Back then, I spent &lt;strong>hours and hours&lt;/strong> just trying to figure out how I could write (and compile) a single C program that would run on all three major platforms: Windows, macOS, and Linux.
Chris used &lt;a href="https://www.glfw.org/" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GLFW3&lt;/a> to solve this problem while mine used &lt;a href="https://www.libsdl.org/" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SDL2&lt;/a> (both are valid options).
Here is a screenshot of the demo for reference:&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Why Write?</title><link>https://shallowbrooksoftware.com/posts/why-write/</link><pubDate>Sun, 07 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shallowbrooksoftware.com/posts/why-write/</guid><description>&lt;p>How long has it been since my last post?
Let&amp;rsquo;s see&amp;hellip; about a week shy of 3 years!
Blogging is one of those &amp;ldquo;things I&amp;rsquo;d like to do more of&amp;rdquo; but never make time for.
I&amp;rsquo;ve still been writing code since my last post but I haven&amp;rsquo;t written about any of it.
I ran my own software company for a while, got a new job at a Silicon Valley startup, and even got married!
There are so many moments of progress and happiness that only exist in my memories (and photos, of course).
I&amp;rsquo;d like to fix this.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
