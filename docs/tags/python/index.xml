This project was written in &lt;a href="https://www.python.org/" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Python&lt;/a> and the design was simple: an HTTP-based interface for storing, getting, and deleting arbitrary content.
Many folks call this type of thing a &amp;ldquo;distributed key-value store&amp;rdquo;.
The project was originally inspired by &lt;a href="https://github.com/chrislusf/seaweedfs" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SeaweedFS&lt;/a> but had the goal of being much, much simpler (ideally less than 1000 lines of code).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The architecture of the program is straightforward: a single &amp;ldquo;index server&amp;rdquo; distributes and organizes data between any number of &amp;ldquo;volume servers&amp;rdquo;.
The actual data could be anything: text, images, &lt;a href="https://www.sqlite.org/index.html" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SQLite&lt;/a> databases.
It doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter!
Everything is just bytes at the end of the day.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Designing Python Web Servers</title><link>https://shallowbrooksoftware.com/posts/designing-python-web-servers/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Sep 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shallowbrooksoftware.com/posts/designing-python-web-servers/</guid><description>&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve spent the last few days designing and benchmarking extremely minimal pure-Python web servers.
There is a tech myth / superstition that exposing python web servers to the internet is a bad idea but I&amp;rsquo;ve seen little to no evidence as to why this is supposedly the case.
Are they too slow?
Are they too insecure for some reason?
One thing is for sure: performance must always be measured, not guessed.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
