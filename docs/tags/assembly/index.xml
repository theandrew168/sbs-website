It seems as though more and more people are feeling and observing bloat and bugginess in their day-to-day usage of computers.
In many situations, the mediocrity of today&amp;rsquo;s technology has become so common that it isn&amp;rsquo;t even seen as an issue.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>During my few years spent in industry, these sort of quotes were heard almost daily:&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Bare-Metal Assembly on the Longan Nano</title><link>https://shallowbrooksoftware.com/posts/bare-metal-assembly-on-the-longan-nano/</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shallowbrooksoftware.com/posts/bare-metal-assembly-on-the-longan-nano/</guid><description>&lt;p>The &lt;a href="https://www.seeedstudio.com/Sipeed-Longan-Nano-RISC-V-GD32VF103CBT6-Development-Board-p-4205.html" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sipeed Longan Nano&lt;/a> is a small, affordable, 32-bit &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RISC-V" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RISC-V&lt;/a> chip.
Despite its minimalism, the Longan Nano provides enough power and peripherals to learn RISC-V assembly and build exciting programs along the way.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Longan Nano comes with the following components:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>GigaDevice GD32VF103[CBT6] 32-bit CPU&lt;/li>
&lt;li>8 MHz default clock speed (IRC8M)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>108 MHz maximum clock speed&lt;/li>
&lt;li>128 KB flash storage&lt;/li>
&lt;li>32 KB sram memory&lt;/li>
&lt;li>3 LEDs (red, green, and blue)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>1 USB Type-C port&lt;/li>
&lt;li>1 microSD card slot&lt;/li>
&lt;li>160x80 pixel LCD (0.96 inches)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>2 Buttons (RESET and BOOT)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>With the specs out of the way, we can begin the journey of figuring out how to go from a blank text file to controlling all aspects of our hardware.
Get ready to discuss registers, design clean programs, and dive into some datasheets.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
