I&amp;rsquo;ve had this idea in my head for a few years: build a functional language in C with a focus on game development. I wanted window creation, OpenGL graphics, and input events to all be first class citizens of the language and not optional libraries to be pulled in later. Cross-platform portability was important, too.</description></item></channel></rss>
