Perhaps your business logic is tightly coupled to the database or maybe you are wanting to test a clearly-defined storage layer. Either way, a common problem arises: how do you clean up the data used during testing? What should you do with all those scattered rows?
Most of the time, developers will resort to a few common strategies:</description></item><item><title>Behavioral Abstractions in TypeScript</title><link>https://shallowbrooksoftware.com/posts/behavioral-abstractions-in-typescript/</link><pubDate>Sun, 03 Mar 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shallowbrooksoftware.com/posts/behavioral-abstractions-in-typescript/</guid><description>Almost every application needs to communicate with the outside world in one form or another.
