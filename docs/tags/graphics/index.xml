      <description>While writing my previous blog post, I realized that there is a general information gap around dynamically loading OpenGL functions. When developers encounter this task on new OpenGL-related projects, they tend to reach for a premade loader such as glew, gl3w, glLoadGen, or GLAD. A more detailed list along with an overview of what all these libraries do can be found here.
&amp;ldquo;An OpenGL Loading Library is a library that loads pointers to OpenGL functions at runtime, core as well as extensions.</description>

      <title>A Multi-Platform Modern OpenGL Demo with SDL2</title>

      <description>This post is largely inspired by Chris Wellons&amp;rsquo; 2015 blog post about writing a modern OpenGL demo that works on all three major desktop platforms (Windows, macOS, and Linux). I have come back to his post countless times over the years when looking for guidance on how to build any cross-platform C program.
In Chris&amp;rsquo; version of this demo he makes use of GLFW3 for the window and input handling and uses gl3w for loading OpenGL functions.</description>
