I read that &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIP-8" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CHIP-8&lt;/a> was a great introductory system and decided to write my own emulator for it.
I was a C programming novice at the time but figured it&amp;rsquo;d still be a good choice for a project that dealt with a lot of low-level details and mechanics.
After a few weeks of work I was able to successfully emulate CHIP-8 games but knew that there were some lingering bugs.
Once I cleaned them up and got the finished the project, I moved on and never touched the codebase again.
