We&amp;rsquo;ve been having a great time so far building houses, cave bases, and clifftop observation decks.
Despite the initial fun, I&amp;rsquo;ve known that the server&amp;rsquo;s security posture was a bit&amp;hellip; shaky.
The server only allows a specific set of usernames to login, but, since the old authentication servers aren&amp;rsquo;t online anymore, the server has no choice but to trust the client.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Automating a Golden Age Minecraft Server</title><link>https://shallowbrooksoftware.com/posts/automating-a-golden-age-minecraft-server/</link><pubDate>Sun, 04 Feb 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shallowbrooksoftware.com/posts/automating-a-golden-age-minecraft-server/</guid><description>&lt;p>Lately, I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed a growing interest in what people like to call &amp;ldquo;Golden Age Minecraft&amp;rdquo; (&lt;a href="https://reddit.com/r/GoldenAgeMinecraft/" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reddit&lt;/a>).
This term typically refers to versions of Minecraft prior to Beta 1.8 / Release 1.0.0: &lt;a href="https://minecraft.wiki/w/Adventure_Update" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Adventure Update&lt;/a>.
This update added a bunch of new features and, for better or for worse, introduced a true &amp;ldquo;goal&amp;rdquo; into the game: build up supplies, reach &lt;a href="https://minecraft.wiki/w/The_End" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The End&lt;/a>, and defeat the &lt;a href="https://minecraft.wiki/w/Ender_Dragon" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ender Dragon&lt;/a>.
Prior to this update, Minecraft had no explicit goals and was truly a sandbox.
The only things to do were explore, build stuff, and find diamonds.
It was a simple loop that generated hundreds of hours of fun for my friends and I back in high school.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
