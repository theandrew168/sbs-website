      <description>I first became aware of minikeyvalue while watching a recording of George&amp;rsquo;s programming livestream. This project was written in Python and the design was simple: an HTTP-based interface for storing, getting, and deleting arbitrary content. Many folks call this type of thing a &amp;ldquo;distributed key-value store&amp;rdquo;. The project was originally inspired by SeaweedFS but had the goal of being much, much simpler (ideally less than 1000 lines of code).
The architecture of the program is straightforward: a single &amp;ldquo;index server&amp;rdquo; distributes and organizes data between any number of &amp;ldquo;volume servers&amp;rdquo;.</description>
