It&amp;rsquo;s already 2025 and I only came across &lt;a href="https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/11653" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this PR&lt;/a> a few weeks ago.
That being said, it was merged in 2024 and I can&amp;rsquo;t recall seeing any other PRs from last year that had me stomping and hollering so hard.
Finding this feature (and the PR) came at a time of frustration: realizing that I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be able to use &lt;a href="https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/latest/systemd.socket.html" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">systemd socket activation&lt;/a> for &lt;a href="https://nextjs.org/" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NextJS&lt;/a> (or &lt;a href="https://remix.run/" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RemixJS&lt;/a>, for that matter) without having to jump through hoops.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Is SvelteKit a Poor Choice for SPAs?</title><link>https://shallowbrooksoftware.com/posts/is-sveltekit-a-poor-choice-for-spas/</link><pubDate>Sun, 14 Jul 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shallowbrooksoftware.com/posts/is-sveltekit-a-poor-choice-for-spas/</guid><description>&lt;p>Recently, I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on the frontend for my &lt;a href="https://bloggulus.com/" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bloggulus&lt;/a> project.
Back in the day, the frontend was implemented via server-rendered HTML pages.
This worked reasonably well, but I always felt like Go&amp;rsquo;s HTML templates were a bit painful to work with.
I also wanted to transition the application&amp;rsquo;s backend to a REST API so that I could use it as a foundation for learning how to build native apps (someday&amp;hellip;).&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
