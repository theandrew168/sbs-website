Any frequent readers of my blog (are you out there?) will surely have heard of it before.
In short, it is a &lt;a href="https://github.com/theandrew168/bloggulus" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">custom-built&lt;/a> RSS feed aggregator combined with a context index powered by PostgreSQL&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/textsearch.html" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">full text search&lt;/a> feature.
I use it as a playground for exploring development strategies, software architecture, and even programming languages.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What originally started out as a simple server-side rendered Go application has since taken on many forms.
For a while it was a full-stack &lt;a href="https://kit.svelte.dev/" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SvelteKit&lt;/a> app, then a REST API backend with a &lt;a href="https://svelte.dev/" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Svelte&lt;/a> frontend, then with a &lt;a href="https://react.dev/" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">React&lt;/a> frontend, and eventually back to server-side rendered Go.
It has really come full circle!
I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t trade the experience and learning for anything, though.
I feel much more well-rounded as a programmer having built the same application in so many different ways.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Bloggulus: Seems Fine</title><link>https://shallowbrooksoftware.com/posts/bloggulus-seems-fine/</link><pubDate>Sun, 22 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shallowbrooksoftware.com/posts/bloggulus-seems-fine/</guid><description>&lt;p>A few weeks ago, &lt;a href="https://rachelbythebay.com" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rachel by the Bay&lt;/a> made another &lt;a href="https://rachelbythebay.com/w/2024/09/13/fs/" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">update post&lt;/a> regarding the RSS correctness system that she&amp;rsquo;s been running.
In these posts, she&amp;rsquo;ll enumerate various feed readers and call out their behavior: for better or for worse.
For the first time, &lt;a href="https://bloggulus.com/" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bloggulus&lt;/a> made it onto the list without any noticeable issues!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://shallowbrooksoftware.com/images/20240922/seems-fine.webp" alt="Bloggulus mentioned on Rachel by the Bay">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To many, &amp;ldquo;seems fine&amp;rdquo; might feel like an underwhelming statement.
But to me, it means everything.
It feels good to know that Bloggulus properly respects caching headers, provides a distinct user agent, and polls at an acceptable rate.
I&amp;rsquo;ve put a &lt;a href="https://shallowbrooksoftware.com/posts/bloggulus-a-responsible-rss-reader/" >decent&lt;/a> &lt;a href="https://shallowbrooksoftware.com/posts/more-bloggulus-rss-improvements/" >amount&lt;/a> of effort into ensuring that Bloggulus follows the rules and is a respectful actor in the context of the greater internet.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>More Bloggulus RSS Improvements</title><link>https://shallowbrooksoftware.com/posts/more-bloggulus-rss-improvements/</link><pubDate>Sun, 11 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shallowbrooksoftware.com/posts/more-bloggulus-rss-improvements/</guid><description>&lt;p>Thanks to &lt;a href="https://rachelbythebay.com/w/" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rachel by the Bay&lt;/a> and her posts about RSS correctness / etiquette, Iâ€™ve been able to more deeply understand the relationship between feeds and readers.
A few months ago, I decided to use &lt;a href="https://bloggulus.com" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bloggulus&lt;/a> to participate in her feed reader scoring program.
I &lt;a href="https://shallowbrooksoftware.com/posts/bloggulus-a-responsible-rss-reader/" >wrote about it&lt;/a> at the time and noted how Bloggulus&amp;rsquo; performance as a responsible RSS reader was &amp;ldquo;good but not great&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Recently, while on vacation, I decided to fix the remaining three issues with Bloggulus:&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Bloggulus Outage Postmortem</title><link>https://shallowbrooksoftware.com/posts/bloggulus-outage-postmortem/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Jun 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shallowbrooksoftware.com/posts/bloggulus-outage-postmortem/</guid><description>&lt;p>On June 4, 2024, &lt;a href="https://bloggulus.com" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bloggulus&lt;/a> was down for just under 7 hours.
Despite being offline for so long, the immediate fix only took only ~30 minutes to find and apply once I became aware of the issue.
This post details how I went about fixing the problem and then digs deeper into what actually happened.
I also discuss a few gaps in server monitoring and notification delivery.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://shallowbrooksoftware.com/images/20240609/downtime.webp" alt="Downtime of roughly seven hours">&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Bloggulus: A Responsible RSS Reader</title><link>https://shallowbrooksoftware.com/posts/bloggulus-a-responsible-rss-reader/</link><pubDate>Sun, 02 Jun 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shallowbrooksoftware.com/posts/bloggulus-a-responsible-rss-reader/</guid><description>&lt;p>Recently, Rachel by the Bay &lt;a href="https://rachelbythebay.com/w/2024/05/29/score/" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote about an idea&lt;/a> for &amp;ldquo;scoring&amp;rdquo; RSS feed readers.
Criteria would be things like: how often do they check, do they respect &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/If-None-Match" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">caching headers&lt;/a>, etc.
Since I maintain my own RSS reader / aggregator called &lt;a href="https://bloggulus.com" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bloggulus&lt;/a>, I was curious to see how responsible my own program was.
Her previous posts have directly influenced my ability to make Bloggulus more efficient and more correct.
I messaged Rachel with interest in participating and she promptly replied with instructions on how to set things up.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
