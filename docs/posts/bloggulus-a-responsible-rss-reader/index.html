Criteria would be things like: how often do they check, do they respect <a href=https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/If-None-Match class=external-link target=_blank rel=noopener>caching headers</a>, etc.
Since I maintain my own RSS reader / aggregator called <a href=https://bloggulus.com class=external-link target=_blank rel=noopener>Bloggulus</a>, I was curious to see how responsible my own program was.
Her previous posts have directly influenced my ability to make Bloggulus more efficient and more correct.
I messaged Rachel with interest in participating and she promptly replied with instructions on how to set things up.</p><p>Fast-forward a few days and Bloggulus is scoring quite well!</p><p><img src=/images/20240602/rss-score.webp alt="RSS reader score"></p><p>It has only sent one unconditional request (which is expected when a new feed is added).
All <code>If-None-Match</code> header values (this is a cache-related header) have been valid.
No useless cookies, referrers, or query params have been sent, either.
Not bad!</p><p>Sometimes, however, Bloggulus ends up polling slightly more oftan than the intended hourly schedule.
Occasionally, it&rsquo;ll re-poll after 59 minutes which isn&rsquo;t huge deal (just subtle timing variance).
Once, though, it re-requested content after only 44 minutes.
I&rsquo;m not 100% sure <em>why</em> this happened but it could be that the server restarted.
When that happens, the &ldquo;wait an hour before polling again&rdquo; timer gets restarted (likely for unattended upgrades).
I do have logic in-place to prevent &ldquo;restart spam&rdquo; by ensuring that a single feed doesn&rsquo;t polled more than once every 30 minutes.
I might consider increasing that duration value.</p><p>Anyhow, thanks for reading and for keeping your RSS readers responsible!</p></div><footer></footer></article></section></div><footer class=footer><section class=container>©
