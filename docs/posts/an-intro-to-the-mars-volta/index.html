<span class=sr-only>Link to heading</span></a></h1><p>Here&rsquo;s a good intro to The Mars Volta.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5jcgJ3RNpo" class=external-link target=_blank rel=noopener>Wax Simulacra</a> is their most popular song (it won a Grammy).
I&rsquo;d say this goes &ldquo;medium&rdquo; compared to their other stuff: some tracks are softer and others are harder.
As far as &ldquo;softer&rdquo; goes, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MrFkLDsgRcE" class=external-link target=_blank rel=noopener>Televators</a> was the first song that allowed me to appreciate the band.
Prior to hearing it, I just thought that their music was chaotic noise.
Once I gave them more time, I started to think of it more as organized noise!
There is a lot going on in some of the harder tracks.</p><p>Speaking of which, I think <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcDBOEOxmAY" class=external-link target=_blank rel=noopener>Metatron</a> is one of their most intense (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrwMMF2QS14" class=external-link target=_blank rel=noopener>Goliath</a> is another good example).
It goes hard from start to finish with lots of twists and turns.
This track definitely warrants some nice headphones + high volume.
All of their tracks warrant nice headphones, honesty.
Lastly, if you want a longer &ldquo;gotta focus and write some code&rdquo; experience.
I like this version of their album <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3l16a0TTGA" class=external-link target=_blank rel=noopener>Amputechture</a> which has been EQ&rsquo;d with punchier drums.</p><p>Overall, I&rsquo;d say that The Mars Volta is an acquired taste.
I wasn&rsquo;t initially a fan but now they are probably my #1 or #2 band.
They broke up for a while but are back together and making new music.
They even have a new album coming in April, I&rsquo;ve heard!</p><h1 id=wrapping-up>Wrapping Up
<a class=heading-link href=#wrapping-up><i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden=true title="Link to heading"></i>
<span class=sr-only>Link to heading</span></a></h1><p>If you are on the hunt for new music and enjoy prog-rock, check out some of the tracks I linked.
Then, if you don&rsquo;t enjoy <em>any</em> of them, no worries!
If you <em>do</em> like them, however, then we should get a beer (coffee works, too).</p></div><footer></footer></article></section></div><footer class=footer><section class=container>©
