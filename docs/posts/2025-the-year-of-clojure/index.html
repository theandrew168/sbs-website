<a class=heading-link href=#the-year-of-clojure><i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden=true title="Link to heading"></i>
<span class=sr-only>Link to heading</span></a></h2><p>My experience with the language is fairly limited: I re-implemented Alex Edwards&rsquo; <a href=https://github.com/theandrew168/snippetbox class=external-link target=_blank rel=noopener>snippetbox</a> application in Clojure while waiting for a delayed flight back in 2022 (you should definitely read his <a href=https://lets-go.alexedwards.net/ class=external-link target=_blank rel=noopener>Let&rsquo;s Go</a> book, by the way).
While the experience was fun, I feel like I simply translated the code directly from Go to Clojure without doing much &ldquo;idiomatic alignment&rdquo;.
I think a Clojure expert would implement a project like that much differently.
That being said, Clojure (well, the Java ecosystem) does have some extra perks that make it appealing to me: single-file deployments and easily-embeddable resources.
Gotta love JARs!</p><p>Every talk I watch about Clojure fascinates me.

<span class=sr-only>Link to heading</span></a></h1><p>In my head, 2024 was the “Year of Balance”.
It was about trying to appreciate nuance: the subtle grays between black and white.
There is always good and bad: perfection is rare.
Sometimes in life, we get busy and sometimes we struggle.
In those times, some people withdraw from personal connections and focus on themselves.
I think is fine in moderation.
After all, you have do whatever you can to work things out: even if it means focusing on yourself for a while.</p><p>But, once the storm passes, should you reach back out?
In my friend group, we often refer to this as &ldquo;ghost busting&rdquo;.
Should this idea also be a consideration for next year?
I was chatting with a friend who feels like maybe it should.
Perhaps 2025 can also be the “Year of Closure” (homophone intended).</p><p>Thanks for reading!</p></div><footer></footer></article></section></div><footer class=footer><section class=container>©
