I&rsquo;ve tried to get into the setting, themes, and gameplay, but it could never hook me.
Am I too impatient?
Does the game give the player <em>too much</em> freedom and not enough direction?
It must be a “me” problem.
The game is critically acclaimed but I can&rsquo;t seem to enjoy it: more importantly, I <em>want</em> to enjoy it but haven&rsquo;t been able to.
If I had tried to play it when I was much younger, I&rsquo;m sure it would&rsquo;ve completely blown my mind.</p><p>What if I was stuck in a cabin in the woods for some number of months with only myself, nature, and an air-gapped computer with Morrowind installed (the essentials, right?).
Would I finally be able to enjoy it?
More so, could I completely immerse myself into the fantasy universe because, compared to the woods, it was an exciting adventure?
Or would I still, in this environment that has so little going on and moves so slowly, find the game uninteresting and boring?</p><p>Perhaps this is a dopamine problem.
I just finished reading <a href=https://www.annalembke.com/dopamine-nation class=external-link target=_blank rel=noopener>Dopamine Nation</a> so this concept is fresh in my mind.
Are old, slow-burn games hard for me to get into because they aren&rsquo;t as pretty / gripping / flashy as today&rsquo;s games (looking at you, <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Trading_Card_Game_Pocket class=external-link target=_blank rel=noopener>Pokemon TCG Pocket</a>)?
Could I enjoy this game at an isolated cabin because it would effectively be a forced dopamine reset?
When living in the woods, <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walden class=external-link target=_blank rel=noopener>Thoreau</a> was able to find beauty in even the smallest of things.</p><p>I don&rsquo;t know what the answer is, but I might have to start looking for a cabin.</p></div><footer></footer></article></section></div><footer class=footer><section class=container>©
