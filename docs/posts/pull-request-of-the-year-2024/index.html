It&rsquo;s already 2025 and I only came across <a href=https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/11653 class=external-link target=_blank rel=noopener>this PR</a> a few weeks ago.
That being said, it was merged in 2024 and I can&rsquo;t recall seeing any other PRs from last year that had me stomping and hollering so hard.
Finding this feature (and the PR) came at a time of frustration: realizing that I wouldn&rsquo;t be able to use <a href=https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/latest/systemd.socket.html class=external-link target=_blank rel=noopener>systemd socket activation</a> for <a href=https://nextjs.org/ class=external-link target=_blank rel=noopener>NextJS</a> (or <a href=https://remix.run/ class=external-link target=_blank rel=noopener>RemixJS</a>, for that matter) without having to jump through hoops.</p><h2 id=background>Background
<a class=heading-link href=#background><i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden=true title="Link to heading"></i>
<span class=sr-only>Link to heading</span></a></h2><p>Here&rsquo;s the thing about writing applications that support systemd sockets: it requires zero user configuration (for the app itself, at least) and is a no-op for non-systemd deployments.
If the <code>LISTEN_FDS</code> env var is set, then you can utilize socket file descriptors directly (starting at 3) instead of opening a new one on a given address + port.
If that var is NOT set, then just open the socket like normal.</p><p>Those who know me might ask: why are you even writing web apps in JS?
Aren&rsquo;t you a hardcore Go-based, server-side rendered, semantic HTML with forms developer?
While that is usually true, I do really like TypeScript as a language and I had the itch to build something &ldquo;trendy&rdquo; using &ldquo;trendy&rdquo; tools.
I wanted to see what all the vibe-coding hype was about (while applying my own supervision and scrutiny, of course).
I used <a href=https://v0.dev/ class=external-link target=_blank rel=noopener>v0.dev</a> to build a quick prototype and since <em>that</em> used Next.js by default, that&rsquo;s where I decided to start.</p><h2 id=custom-servers>Custom Servers
<a class=heading-link href=#custom-servers><i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden=true title="Link to heading"></i>
<span class=sr-only>Link to heading</span></a></h2><p>By the end of my research, I&rsquo;d given up any hope of finding first-party support for this and figured I&rsquo;d have to run the application with a &ldquo;custom server&rdquo;: where I use Node&rsquo;s <a href=https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#class-httpserver class=external-link target=_blank rel=noopener>http server</a> directly to host the pre-built application.
With <a href=https://nextjs.org/ class=external-link target=_blank rel=noopener>Next.js</a>, this is supported but it has <a href=https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/guides/custom-server class=external-link target=_blank rel=noopener>limitations</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Before deciding to use a custom server, keep in mind that it should only be used when the integrated router of Next.js can&rsquo;t meet your app requirements. A custom server will remove important performance optimizations, like Automatic Static Optimization.</p></blockquote><p>For <a href=https://remix.run/ class=external-link target=_blank rel=noopener>Remix</a>, you use the <a href=https://remix.run/docs/en/main/other-api/adapter#createrequesthandler class=external-link target=_blank rel=noopener>createRequestHandler</a> function from the <code>@remix-run/express</code> package to create the proper handler and then host it with your own <a href=https://expressjs.com/ class=external-link target=_blank rel=noopener>Express</a> server.
This would probably work for my use case but I wasn&rsquo;t using Remix at the time.</p><p>All that said, I wouldn&rsquo;t need any of this &ldquo;custom server&rdquo; stuff if these libraries had built-in support for checking for systemd sockets and using them (instead of opening their own).
I looked into the NextJS source code to consider if I could add this behavior myself but the lead time for developing, testing, and merging such a change would surpass my project timeline.
I may still do this in the future, though, since a reference implementation already exists&mldr; in <a href=https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/introduction class=external-link target=_blank rel=noopener>SvelteKit</a>!</p><h2 id=sveltekit>SvelteKit
<a class=heading-link href=#sveltekit><i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden=true title="Link to heading"></i>
<span class=sr-only>Link to heading</span></a></h2><p>Honestly, my expectations were so low that I didn&rsquo;t even start my search by checking if SvelteKit had builtin support for socket activation: I just figured I&rsquo;d have to take the build output and run it with my own custom Node server like all the others.
That led me to the <a href=https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/adapter-node class=external-link target=_blank rel=noopener>adapter-node</a> docs.
While this adapter <em>does</em> easily support deploying a pre-built SvelteKit app with a custom server, I didn&rsquo;t even need it.
Looking at the sidebar, I couldn&rsquo;t believe my eyes: there was a section titled &ldquo;Socket activation&rdquo;.
It was <em>exactly</em> what I&rsquo;d been looking for.
I was honestly slack-jawed while reading through it.</p><p>I thought to myself: someone in the SvelteKit community cares enough about traditional app deployment strategies to add this to the project?
I had to see <a href=https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/11653 class=external-link target=_blank rel=noopener>the PR</a> for myself.
Did the whole feature come in one PR or was it multiple? Just one.
Did one person write it? Just one (<a href=https://github.com/karimfromjordan class=external-link target=_blank rel=noopener>Karim Jordan</a>).
How did the implementation work? It checks the env vars and, if socket activation is detected, passes the <code>fd</code> to the Node http server.
Was it complex or relatively simple? Pretty simple!</p><h2 id=conclusion>Conclusion
<a class=heading-link href=#conclusion><i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden=true title="Link to heading"></i>
<span class=sr-only>Link to heading</span></a></h2><p>Seeing this PR really made my day.
I&rsquo;m happy to know that SvelteKit supports systemd socket activation out-of-the-box (it also supports <a href=https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/adapter-node#Graceful-shutdown class=external-link target=_blank rel=noopener>graceful shutdown</a> and <a href=https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/adapter-node#Environment-variables-IDLE_TIMEOUT class=external-link target=_blank rel=noopener>idle timeout</a>, by the way).
If this is actually already possible with Next.js or Remix and I simply missed it in the documentation, please let me know!
Until then, I&rsquo;ll be sticking with the framework that respects my server-ful, single node, systemd socket activated, &ldquo;old school&rdquo; style of <a href=/posts/deploying-multi-file-web-applications/>deploying applications</a>.</p></div><footer></footer></article></section></div><footer class=footer><section class=container>©
