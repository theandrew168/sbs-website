The games are quick, the mechanics are engaging, and the community is friendly.
Plus, I was a big fan of the Digimon anime as a kid so I have a lot of nostalgia for the characters.
When I first got into the game, I realized that only a few sets had been released so far.
I set my eyes on building and maintaining a complete collection: four copies of each card.
With enough spreadsheets and time, this would allow me build any deck that I wanted.
This was honestly a breath of fresh air coming from <a href=https://magic.wizards.com/en class=external-link target=_blank rel=noopener>Magic: The Gathering</a>.</p><h1 id=digimon-cards>Digimon Cards
<a class=heading-link href=#digimon-cards><i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden=true title="Link to heading"></i>
<span class=sr-only>Link to heading</span></a></h1><p>That being said, I&rsquo;ve collected quite a few cards.
In addition to the minimum four copies of each card, I also have extra copies of most common and uncommon cards (and even some rares).
Historically, I stored these extra cards unsorted in a series of tall, unstable stacks.
&ldquo;Managing&rdquo; these stacks was simple: whenever a new set releases and I acquire more overflow, just throw &rsquo;em on the stack!
Recently, however, a couple things happened that motivated me to sort and organize my collection.</p><p>First, a friend of mine told me that they were building a binder with all Digimon cards illustrated by a particular artist: <a href=https://wikimon.net/Koki class=external-link target=_blank rel=noopener>koki</a>.
Since I have so many extra cards, I told them that I&rsquo;d be willing to go through my collection and see if I could fill in any missing pieces.
However, since my cards were unsorted, this would mean looking through every single card in my collection.
That seemed pretty tedious and I figured that if I was going to touch every card, I might as well sort them.</p><p>Second, I was about to move to a new house and moving those loose stacks of cards didn&rsquo;t seem very fun.
I&rsquo;d rather buy a large, multi-row trading card box to contain them.
If I was going to buy a nice box, I might as well use the individual rows to hold cards of a particular color.
This way, to find a card of a specific color, I&rsquo;d only have to look through a subset (roughly 1/6th of all cards).
I ultimately decided to sort my collection by even more than just color: I further sorted them by card type and level.
Now, to find any specific card, I&rsquo;d have to search through <em>even fewer</em> cards (around 1/36th or so).</p><h1 id=database-indexes>Database Indexes
<a class=heading-link href=#database-indexes><i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden=true title="Link to heading"></i>
<span class=sr-only>Link to heading</span></a></h1><p>While sorting my cards and thinking about software (a classic combination), I realized a connection to database indexes.
By sorting my collection, I was effectively transforming it into an <a href=https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/indexes-intro.html class=external-link target=_blank rel=noopener>index</a>.
If I had chosen to only sort by color, then it’d mirror a regular, single-column index.
Instead, sorting by color, type, and level maps more closely to a <a href=https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/indexes-multicolumn.html class=external-link target=_blank rel=noopener>multi-column index</a>.</p><p>If this configuration was represented in PostgreSQL, the schema and index would look something like:</p><pre tabindex=0><code>CREATE TABLE card (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  name TEXT,
  color TEXT,
  type TEXT,
  level TEXT
);

CREATE INDEX card_idx ON card (color, type, level);
</code></pre><p>Instead of having to sequentially scan through all of my cards to find a specific one, I could instead jump to the specific color + type + level and only have to search through a handful.
By indexing my cards, lookups are elevated from a <code>Seq Scan</code> to an <code>Index Scan</code>.
However, my collection is now also susceptible to one of the downsides of indexes: increased insertion time.</p><p>Before, adding new cards was instant: just add them to the stack.
Now the process is more involved.
I need to first use the index to lookup where a specific card should go and <em>then</em> insert it.
This adds a mild amount of overhead to every single card that gets added to the box.
It takes work to maintain an index but if you have a read-heavy workload, it is probably worth it.</p></div><footer></footer></article></section></div><footer class=footer><section class=container>©
