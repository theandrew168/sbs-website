I&rsquo;m not building any particular application or product with it, I simply find it interesting!
I also thought to myself: maybe this would also be a good reason to explore <a href=https://clojure.org/ class=external-link target=_blank rel=noopener>Clojure</a> (since 2025 is the <a href=/posts/2025-the-year-of-clojure/>Year of Clojure</a>, after all).</p><p>However, after making steady early progress (the easy parts), I found myself somewhat stuck when implementing the algorithm’s main loop.
How do I even do a straightforward “while true” loop in a functional and immutable language?
Realizing that I didn&rsquo;t yet understand how to translate even simple constructs into Clojure&rsquo;s terms, I started to feel like I&rsquo;d bitten off more than I can chew.</p><p>Perhaps I am trying to work too many new concepts at once:</p><ol><li>Learning a new programming language (Clojure)</li><li>Learning a new programming paradigm (Functional)</li><li>Learning a new algorithm family (<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAT_solver class=external-link target=_blank rel=noopener>SAT Solving</a>)</li></ol><p>Maybe I should take a beat, reflect on where I&rsquo;m at, and alter my plan to better isolate these concepts.
After doing so, I decided to make a small pivot.
Instead of starting with Clojure, I&rsquo;ll instead implement the algorithm in a familiar and algorithm-friendly language: <a href=https://www.python.org/ class=external-link target=_blank rel=noopener>Python</a>.
I use Python for <a href=https://adventofcode.com/ class=external-link target=_blank rel=noopener>Advent of Code</a> so I’m quite a bit more familiar with writing short, focused, algorithm-heavy programs.
This isolates the third concept and lets me focus on the hard part first: PubGrub.</p><p>Eventually, once I fully understand the algorithm and have written my own reference implementation, I’ll write the code again in Clojure.
This isolates concepts 1 and 2 which are similar enough to tackle at the same point (plus, you can&rsquo;t really separate them in the first place).
Lesson learned, though: don’t try to mix too many new things at once.</p><p>This is also why I don’t usually recommend that folks attempt Advent of Code with an unfamiliar language.
In my opinion, if you want to obtain all 50 stars with a new language, you’re gonna have a bad time.
If you care more about learning and less about the stars, then I say go for it!</p></div><footer></footer></article></section></div><footer class=footer><section class=container>©
