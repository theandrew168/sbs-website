Regardless of the reason, I did end up posting a few and I think it went okay!</p><h1 id=solid-start>Solid Start
<a class=heading-link href=#solid-start><i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden=true title="Link to heading"></i>
<span class=sr-only>Link to heading</span></a></h1><p>I first shared my recent post about <a href=https://old.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1cw3egv/parsing_recursive_polymorphic_json_in_go/ class=external-link target=_blank rel=noopener>Parsing Recursive Polymorhpic JSON</a>.
This was one received super well!
It was fun post to write and I think it has a nice, practical flow.
Some folks found it interesting and one user even said:</p><blockquote><p>Thank you for writing! This helped my problem :)</p></blockquote><p>Now <em>that</em> feels great to hear.
If my writing can help even one other development make progress, then I&rsquo;m happy.
I mainly write these posts to solidify my own learning, but adding value to others is a nice bonus.</p><h1 id=mixed-middle>Mixed Middle
<a class=heading-link href=#mixed-middle><i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden=true title="Link to heading"></i>
<span class=sr-only>Link to heading</span></a></h1><p>The second blog I posted was an older one called <a href=https://old.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1czkqa9/conditional_embedding_in_go/ class=external-link target=_blank rel=noopener>Conditional Embedding in Go</a>.
I feel like the reception here was a bit more mixed.
While some folks &ldquo;nodded&rdquo; and mentioned how they follow a similar approach, other readers were left somewhat confused.
To summarize their question: why not just use the built-in <code>vite dev</code> server to host the frontend and let Go handle only the backend (while developing locally)?
This is a fair question and it made me pause and ask myself: wait, why <em>didn&rsquo;t</em> I just do that?</p><p>I think that, at the time, my goal was to unite the code paths between local and production (and avoid <a href=https://vitejs.dev/config/server-options.html#server-proxy class=external-link target=_blank rel=noopener>proxying</a>, probably).
Instead of using two different servers for local development and embedding the frontend&rsquo;s static files only in prod, why not just <em>always</em> use the latter approach (with a small twist for picking up local changes).
Did I get bit tunnel-visioned on that specific facet of the problem?
Maybe, but I still prefer my &ldquo;conditional embedding&rdquo; strategy at the end of the day.</p><h1 id=foggy-finish>Foggy Finish
<a class=heading-link href=#foggy-finish><i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden=true title="Link to heading"></i>
<span class=sr-only>Link to heading</span></a></h1><p>When readers are critical, my gut reaction is to be defensive or delete the post altogether.
However, after some consideration, I realize that the reality isn&rsquo;t so bleak.
After all, 2024 is the year of balance.
What I realized what twofold: perhaps they don&rsquo;t fully understand the exact nature of the problem I was solving and perhaps I don&rsquo;t understand their experience and knowledge.
We should probably all listen, ask questions, and eventually meet in the middle.</p><h1 id=ps>P.S.

<span class=sr-only>Link to heading</span></a></h1><p>Also, my wife and I just bought a house!
Since then, I&rsquo;ve been very busy fixing things, cleaning, and painting.
It has been a great mix of effort and reward.
Who knew houses had so many walls, doors, and sections of trim??</p></div><footer></footer></article></section></div><footer class=footer><section class=container>©
