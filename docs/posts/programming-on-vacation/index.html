My wife and I (and some friends) are headed down to the Lake of the Ozarks to swim, boat around, and chill.
That being said, I genuinely enjoy programming and vacations give me time to &ldquo;switch gears&rdquo; and adapt a different development schedule.
See, while we are here, people are always around: chatting and having a good time.
We also tend to change plans on the fly which makes committing to long blocks of uninterruped time difficult.
I love these aspects of vacation but they make deep work somewhat difficult.</p><p>For me, deep work requires isolation and quietness in order to be successful.
But again, that&rsquo;s fine!
This is vacation after all.
Relaxing and socializing are my priorities down here.
However, there are still <em>some</em> tasks I can tackle.
In fact, I think that this environment might be the <strong>best</strong> fit for certain genres of tasks: those that seem too simple / tedious / mundane to be worth wasting valuable focus time at home.</p><p>For example, this is a great opportunity to explore new testing strategies (like Go&rsquo;s <a href=https://dave.cheney.net/2013/06/30/how-to-write-benchmarks-in-go class=external-link target=_blank rel=noopener>benchmark</a> feature).
I added a simple <a href=https://github.com/theandrew168/bloggulus/commit/6495db10f9f5fb98b1cf91683f0162aa5127e346 class=external-link target=_blank rel=noopener>BenchmarkParse</a> test to <a href=https://github.com/theandrew168/bloggulus class=external-link target=_blank rel=noopener>Bloggulus</a> to get a sense of how long parsing a simple RSS feed takes.
Granted, I don&rsquo;t ever expect that to be one of the application&rsquo;s bottlenecks, but I like the experience of seeing what it takes to write that sort of performance-oriented test.</p><p>Another good vacation task is documentation!
One of my other side projects is a very early-days, bare-bones game idea called <a href=https://github.com/theandrew168/bugforth class=external-link target=_blank rel=noopener>bugforth</a>.
It is being written for the browser with <a href=https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGL_API class=external-link target=_blank rel=noopener>WebGL</a> graphics and a <a href=https://svelte.dev/ class=external-link target=_blank rel=noopener>Svelte</a> UI.
I&rsquo;ve been hacking on the code long enough that I figured it was time to explain how things work (especially the WebGL / batch renderer aspects).
So, this trip is a great time to go through all of the code and <a href=https://github.com/theandrew168/bugforth/commit/877f1dce897cd1b3c309bbfd75142ce448eb6bff class=external-link target=_blank rel=noopener>document</a> the project&rsquo;s classes, methods, and functions!
Adding docs requires little focus but adds a ton of value to any project.</p><p>Even on vacation, it is possible to find small but valuable tasks to get done.
I like to save the deep work for home and make the most of my time off.
Thanks for reading!</p></div><footer></footer></article></section></div><footer class=footer><section class=container>©
