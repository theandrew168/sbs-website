<span class=sr-only>Link to heading</span></a></h2><p>Given that summary, my friend <a href=https://github.com/minhio class=external-link target=_blank rel=noopener>Minh</a> asked a follow-up question:</p><blockquote><p>What would you recommend for production apps?
Not for milliions of users, but say &ldquo;a startup at the bootstrap stage&rdquo;.</p></blockquote><p>I wrote a lengthy answer in Discord but wanted to share it here for visibility and preservation.
That being said, my opinions are still changing as I write more code, deploy more services, and experience the pros and cons of different strategies.</p><h2 id=my-answer>My Answer
<a class=heading-link href=#my-answer><i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden=true title="Link to heading"></i>
<span class=sr-only>Link to heading</span></a></h2><p>Honestly, I&rsquo;m not sure since none of my personal projects have ever made it that far.
If I was using a stack that builds into a single binary (like a <a href=https://go.dev/ class=external-link target=_blank rel=noopener>Go</a>-based app), then I&rsquo;d probably deploy it onto a standard VPS (virtual private server) via <a href=https://www.digitalocean.com/ class=external-link target=_blank rel=noopener>Digital Ocean</a> or <a href=https://www.linode.com/ class=external-link target=_blank rel=noopener>Linode</a> (I&rsquo;m a bit biased against AWS but that&rsquo;s mostly subjective).
My current approach for deploying single-binary Go apps is to build them into a <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deb_%28file_format%29 class=external-link target=_blank rel=noopener>deb package</a> via <a href=https://goreleaser.com/ class=external-link target=_blank rel=noopener>GoReleaser</a>.
The deb handles user creation, systemd unit setup, etc.
Then I use <a href=https://www.ansible.com/ class=external-link target=_blank rel=noopener>Ansible</a> to perform basic server setup and install the deb.</p><p>For non single binary stacks (NodeJS, Django, and basically everything else), I prefer to deploy the app as a container in order to ensure all the deps / static files are located where the app expects them.
I&rsquo;ve messed with deploying these stacks with Ansible but it never feels very clean.
You&rsquo;ve gotta check out the code, ideally create a virtual environment, install the deps, and run the app from that virtual env.
Kinda fussy but I&rsquo;m sure there is room for improvement in these types of apps on traditional servers.</p><p>That being said, I&rsquo;ve only messed with Fly for deploying containerized hobby projects.
If I was going to deploy something more serious, I might consider using a managed <a href=https://kubernetes.io/ class=external-link target=_blank rel=noopener>Kubernetes</a> environment (Digital Ocean and Linode both offer managed Kubernetes).
However, there is a non-zero chance that that&rsquo;d feel too fussy / complex / unreliable and I&rsquo;d revert back to a traditional server deployment.
Or perhaps I&rsquo;d be surprised and find that using Fly / Kubernetes in production is a dream and I prefer it to traditional servers.
Time will tell. 😂</p><p>I even wonder if there is a future where I transition out of the deb approach and align on containers for <em>all</em> tech stacks.
Then, even for single-binary VPS deployments, I&rsquo;d install docker and run the app as a single container without any resource restrictions.
If / when the time comes to &ldquo;scale up&rdquo;, I&rsquo;ve already got the container and I just need to migrate from a single server to a managed Kubernetes environment.
This idea is attractive to me because it&rsquo;d work for any stack.
I&rsquo;m know that many developers already do this.</p><p>If the app requires a database, I&rsquo;m torn between self-hosting (on another VPS) or rolling with something managed (Digital Ocean and Linode both offer managed databases).
Self-hosting Postgres is cheaper than managed and backups are pretty easy, but the high-availability machinery isn&rsquo;t something I&rsquo;ve ever configured and tested myself.
Given that, I&rsquo;d probably use a managed database if I had any sort of income or actual users.
Maybe even one of the fancier new ones like Neon as I mentioned earlier.
I&rsquo;d have to do some pricing estimation, of course.</p><h2 id=tldr>TL:DR
<a class=heading-link href=#tldr><i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden=true title="Link to heading"></i>
<span class=sr-only>Link to heading</span></a></h2><p>There are so many options and I&rsquo;m still undecided on a &ldquo;best stack&rdquo;.
I do know that I&rsquo;ll always avoid &ldquo;one-way door&rdquo; stacks such as fully-serverless AWS or CloudFlare.
I don&rsquo;t want to depend on anything that isn&rsquo;t ubiquitous across hosting providers.
If (when) my opinions change as time goes on and I get more experience, I&rsquo;ll be sure to post updates!</p></div><footer></footer></article></section></div><footer class=footer><section class=container>©
