6-minute read</span></div></div></header><div class=post-content><p>Back on July 5, 2022, I had the urge to play a different trading card some: something new but nostalgic.
I&rsquo;d been playing <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic:_The_Gathering class=external-link target=_blank rel=noopener>Magic: The Gathering</a> since high school and wanted to things up and experience something unfamiliar.
I came up with a simple idea: I&rsquo;ll run to target and pick up a couple <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yu-Gi-Oh!_Trading_Card_Game class=external-link target=_blank rel=noopener>Yu-Gi-Oh</a> starter decks!
I vaguely remember playing Yu-Gi-Oh back in elementary school but had no idea what the game is like today.
However, my local Target only had one starter deck in stock.</p><p>Feeling frustrated, I glanced over to left.
There I saw two <em>different</em> starter decks (<a href=https://digimoncardgame.fandom.com/wiki/ST-9:_Starter_Deck_Ultimate_Ancient_Dragon class=external-link target=_blank rel=noopener>ST9</a> and <a href=https://digimoncardgame.fandom.com/wiki/ST-10:_Starter_Deck_Parallel_World_Tactician class=external-link target=_blank rel=noopener>ST10</a>) for a completely separate and unexpected card game: Digimon.
I didn&rsquo;t even realize that Digimon had a modern card game.
I remember them having one back when I was young but I never actually played it.
The Digimon anime was always pretty awesome, though (as a kid, at least).
I thought &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;, and bought those two Digimon decks while having no awareness of the path I&rsquo;d started myself down.</p><p>That summer was spent with my friends, learning the rules of this new card game.
I bought a few booster boxes of older sets and found myself with an urge&mldr; to collect.
The fun started with a single spreadsheet: tracking what sets had been released up until that point.
I noted the current market value of each box and included links of where to find them.
At some point, I decided that I wanted to collect a playset (four copies) of each card.
That way, I&rsquo;d always be able to brew and play any deck I wanted!</p><p>Fast forward to today and I&rsquo;m still collecting.
My friends and I don&rsquo;t play the game very often, sadly.
The local scene here in central Iowa is also somewhat slow and uneventful.
Nevertheless, I&rsquo;m still locked in to the market and hammering spreadsheets (let the heavy hitters <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfqerR3d7hQ" class=external-link target=_blank rel=noopener>know</a>).
This post oulines what my collection process looks like today: from the binders I use to opening singles on mail day.
Let&rsquo;s start with the binders!</p><h2 id=binders>Binders
<a class=heading-link href=#binders><i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden=true title="Link to heading"></i>
<span class=sr-only>Link to heading</span></a></h2><p>I store my collection in identical, matte-black 4x3 binders made by <a href=https://us.vaultx.com/collections/card-binders/products/12-pocket-strap-binder class=external-link target=_blank rel=noopener>vaultx</a>.
They hold 120 rows of four cards (for a total of 480) per binder.
Since I&rsquo;m building a &ldquo;playset&rdquo; collection, these binders are great because they can fit all four copies of each card in a single row.
Therefore, each binder can hold up to 120 different cards.
Digimon sets range in size from ~72 to ~115 cards, with the average being around 102.
This means that my playset of every card in a set always fits into a single binder.</p><p><img src=/images/20241124/page.webp alt="Single page of cards"></p><p>The binders are labeled by set and stored vertically.
They get quite heavy so I store them <em>under</em> a shelf (for now).
I do want to obtain a sturdier shelf and print out some nicer labels someday.</p><p><img src=/images/20241124/binders.webp alt="Digimon binders under a shelf"></p><h2 id=alternate-arts>Alternate Arts
<a class=heading-link href=#alternate-arts><i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden=true title="Link to heading"></i>
<span class=sr-only>Link to heading</span></a></h2><p>I also have a second, nicer binder for storing alternate art (rare) cards that overflow beyond my baseline four copies.
This binder came from the Premium Bandai <a href=https://p-bandai.com/us/item/N2710855001001 class=external-link target=_blank rel=noopener>Beelzemon Binder Set</a> and is quite well made.
It&rsquo;s no longer available for purchase directly from Bandai, unfortunately, but you could probably find it from a <a href="https://www.tcgplayer.com/product/514078/storage-albums-bandai-storage-albums-digimon-card-game-premium-binder-set-9-pocket-binder-beelzemon-and-beelstarmon?page=1&amp;Language=English" class=external-link target=_blank rel=noopener>reseller</a> for a slightly higher price.</p><p><img src=/images/20241124/alts.webp alt="Alternate art cards"></p><h2 id=sealed-product>Sealed Product
<a class=heading-link href=#sealed-product><i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden=true title="Link to heading"></i>
<span class=sr-only>Link to heading</span></a></h2><p>Bandai releases (on average) two main sets and one extra set per year.
I typically order two booster boxes of each set.
For the larger, &ldquo;three into two&rdquo; sets (which Bandai has done twice), I order three boxes of each.
Usually, I pre-order the boxes through <a href=https://www.gamenerdz.com/digimon class=external-link target=_blank rel=noopener>GameNerdz</a> since they are an awesome distributor!
Sometimes, however, supply and demand cause them to sell out before a set releases and even for weeks after.
In that case, I&rsquo;ll find a backup seller on <a href=https://www.tcgplayer.com/ class=external-link target=_blank rel=noopener>TCGplayer</a> and order my boxes there.</p><h2 id=opening-packs>Opening Packs
<a class=heading-link href=#opening-packs><i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden=true title="Link to heading"></i>
<span class=sr-only>Link to heading</span></a></h2><p>This is the second fun part (after the spreadsheets): opening packs and slotting the cards into their respective binders.
I usually open four to six packs at a time over the course of a few weeks (often during meetings).
I like spacing out the cracking process to give me something to look forward to.</p><h2 id=tracking-missing-singles>Tracking Missing Singles
<a class=heading-link href=#tracking-missing-singles><i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden=true title="Link to heading"></i>
<span class=sr-only>Link to heading</span></a></h2><p>My second spreadsheet is for tracking missing singles.
I include the card info, quantity, market value, and total estimated cost to backfill.
Totals higher than $10 are yellow, higher than $50 are light red, and higher than $100 are dark red.</p><p><img src=/images/20241124/singles.webp alt="Tracking missing singles"></p><h2 id=bulk-ordering>Bulk Ordering
<a class=heading-link href=#bulk-ordering><i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden=true title="Link to heading"></i>
<span class=sr-only>Link to heading</span></a></h2><p>I order all of my missing singles (in batches) from TCGplayer.
I try to optimize the cart to minimize the number of packages and prioritize trusted sellers.
I wish the cart optimization process was more advanced and had even more settings.
If TCGplayer had an active and extensive API, I&rsquo;d try to write a better opimizer myself!
I like to avoid single-card orders even if it means paying slightly more from a seller that is already in my cart.
Often, the additional shipping of a single-card order outweighs the increase of the next-lowest price.</p><h2 id=tracking-orders>Tracking Orders
<a class=heading-link href=#tracking-orders><i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden=true title="Link to heading"></i>
<span class=sr-only>Link to heading</span></a></h2><p>Orders are tracked in my third (and final) spreadsheet.
Orders that have been placed but are not yet shipped are colored red while shipped orders are colored yellow.</p><p><img src=/images/20241124/orders.webp alt="Tracking orders"></p><h2 id=mail-day>Mail Day
<a class=heading-link href=#mail-day><i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden=true title="Link to heading"></i>
<span class=sr-only>Link to heading</span></a></h2><p>The third fun part: mail day!
I grab the mail, check what cards were received, and compare them against my &ldquo;Orders&rdquo; spreadsheet.
Fun fact: I only care about checking the mail when I know cards are coming.</p><p><img src=/images/20241124/mail.webp alt="Opening mail"></p><p>If something is amiss, I&rsquo;ll double check the TCGplayer order and see if I messed up the order of if the seller made a mistake in what they sent.
Thankfully, mistakes happen pretty infrequently.
Some packages do get &ldquo;lost in the mail&rdquo;, though.
When these mistakes happen, the cards that never arrived get moved back into the &ldquo;Singles&rdquo; spreadsheet and will be re-purchased in a future batch order.
For complete, on-time orders, I always leave positive feedback on TCGplayer.
I like to give credit to the responsible sellers!</p><p><img src=/images/20241124/feedback.webp alt="TCGplayer feedback"></p><h2 id=conclusion>Conclusion
<a class=heading-link href=#conclusion><i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden=true title="Link to heading"></i>
<span class=sr-only>Link to heading</span></a></h2><p>It&rsquo;s pretty crazy to reflect and observe this whole process documented in one place.
I developed it organically over the course of a few years.
Despite the fuss, I like &ldquo;solving&rdquo; this uncertainty-oriented TCG with an intentional processe that converges on completion.
Having a full playset of every card means that I&rsquo;ll always be able to build each and every deck I can think of.</p><p>Now I just need the game to become more popular!</p></div><footer></footer></article></section></div><footer class=footer><section class=container>©
