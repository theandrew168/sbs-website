I've recently been on a "project manager arc".
Recently at work, I've been overseeing my first project as a tech lead / project manager (myself and two other devs).
Despite some initial hiccups in spending way too much making tickets that were too specific, things have been going well.
Originally, I tried to plan the entire two months of work upfront.
In addition to trying to plan too far into the future, I made the tickets too specific: including details about _how_ the work should done (with code snippets).
Instead, I think it would've been quicker (and better) to ensure the tickets accurately described _what_ needed to be done.
The devs on my team are very competent and they are more than capable of figuring out the "how".

# Pyramids

Something I realized early on was the importance of iterative development and prioritizing a usable product every step of the way.
As soon as possible, try to get something working (an MVP).
Then, try to add features incrementally such that the app is always usable: just with more functionality.

The alternative would be to plan the entire feature at once, build the from the bottom up, and only have something usable at the very end of the project.
This is pretty bad.
The sooner you can get things in front of the design / product team, the better.
That way they can interact with the feature and see if their ideas are taking shape as they expected.
Does it feel good to use?
Does it looks as nice as expected?
Does it make the application better as a whole?

While reading a [blog post](https://danielchasehooper.com/posts/shapeup/) by Daniel Hooper, he explained this concept with a very simple image:

<img src="/images/20240512/pyramid.webp" alt="Two ways to build a pyramid" style="width: 100%" />

On the left, you build the entire project from the ground up and have nothing to use / test / verify until the very end.
On the right, you first build the MVP (minimum viable pyramid) and then iterative enhance it until the full project is complete.
This analogy has been used before:

Corresponds with principle #3 of the [Agile Manifesto](https://www.agilealliance.org/agile101/12-principles-behind-the-agile-manifesto/):

> Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.

# Conclusion

This line of thinking impacted how I planned my first multi-developer, multi-month software project.
Despite trying to plan the entire project upfront (waterfall style), I adjusted my plan to prioritize delivering an MVP of the new feature so that early input could be collected from the product team.
Over the next few weeks, we will be iteratively enhancing the feature with additional functionality.
At each step along the way, the changes will be usable and testable by the project's stakeholders.
