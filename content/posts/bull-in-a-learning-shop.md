Building skills is a balance of “reading” and “doing” (planning vs building, taking vs giving, observing vs expressing, input vs output).
They are both important and I don’t think much progress can be made without both.
With only reading, the experience is only theoretical.
With only doing, how do you know if you are improving or just going in circle?

Sometimes, I get caught up on “reading” for too long: reading books but not applying the concepts.
I think this is due to fear: fear of failing, breaking something, bumbling around, getting frustrated, or just feeling lost.
However, “doing” is necessary and can often be a quicker path to success.

Sometimes you just have to go for it, like a bull in a learning shop (lol).
Get in there, thrash around, break stuff, but gain valuable and practical insight about things.
Fire up the editor and just write some Clojure: you’ve read enough.
Just queue for the dungeon and figure it out: you’ve watched enough videos and the mechanics aren’t that complicated.
The cost of “failure” in these cases is nothing more than a bruised ego.

Despite that, you should remember: you can’t be good at something unless you have been bad at it for a long time.
Don’t let fear of failure prevent you from trying, because you _will_ fail.
We all have.
