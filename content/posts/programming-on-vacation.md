Use vacations as a time for small, meaningful changes to a code base.
For example, explore a new method of testing (Go benchmarks) or add documentation to a project (bugforth).
These tasks aren’t so large and deep that they require intense focus so you can stay social and flexible.
Plus, these tasks are ones that I don’t tend to get to while at home and working on more critical / important things.
