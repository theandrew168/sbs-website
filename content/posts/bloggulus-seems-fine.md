A few weeks ago, [Rachel by the Bay](https://rachelbythebay.com) made another [update post](https://rachelbythebay.com/w/2024/09/13/fs/) regarding the RSS correctness system that she's been running.
In these posts, she'll go over various feed reader and call out ways that they are behaving: for better or for worse.
For the first time, Bloggulus made it onto the list (and in a good way)!

To many, "seems fine" might feel like an underwhelming statement.
But to me, it means everything.
It feels good to know that Bloggulus properly respects caching headers and polls at an acceptable rate.
I've put a [decent](/posts/bloggulus-a-responsible-rss-reader/) [amount](/posts/more-bloggulus-rss-improvements/) of effort into ensuring that Bloggulus follows the rules and is a respectful actor with respect to the greater internet.

This is tech: your are expected to know what you're doing when writing programs that interact with other systems (especially other system **that you do not own**).
That being said, many feed readers _don't_ pass the test and display various issues (Bloggulus used to be one of them).
I'm proud to have made things better.

Overall, it's cool to have learned something from (and interacted loosely) with such a famous tech blogger.
It really made my day!
