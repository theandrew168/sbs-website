At work the other day, I coworker and I were chatting about music.
He is a self-described "Deadhead": a hardcore fan of the [Grateful Dead](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead).
After he shared some songs with me, I wanted to return the favor and recommend some tracks from one of _my_ favorite bands: [The Mars Volta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mars_Volta).
They are a prog-rock band from El Paso, Texas who came into the spotlight in the early 2000s.
I offered up a variety of suggestions ranging from "mild" to "wild" and figured I might as well share my thoughts with a wider audience.
Plus, this gives me a good reason to get back into blogging here in 2025!

# My Recommendations

Here's a good intro to The Mars Volta.
[Wax Simulacra](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5jcgJ3RNpo) is their most popular song (it won a Grammy).
I'd say this goes "medium" compared to their other stuff: some tracks are softer and others are harder.
As far as "softer" goes, [Televators](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MrFkLDsgRcE) was the first song that allowed me to appreciate the band.
Prior to hearing it, I just thought that their music was chaotic noise.
Once I gave them more time, I started to think of it more as organized noise!
There is a lot going on in some of the harder tracks.

Speaking of which, I think [Metatron](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcDBOEOxmAY) is one of their most intense ([Goliath](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrwMMF2QS14) is another good example).
It goes hard from start to finish with lots of twists and turns.
This track definitely warrants some nice headphones + high volume.
All of their tracks warrant nice headphones, honesty.
Lastly, if you want a longer "gotta focus and write some code" experience.
I like this version of their album [Amputechture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3l16a0TTGA) which has been EQ'd with punchier drums.

Overall, I'd say that The Mars Volta is an acquired taste.
I wasn't initially a fan but now they are probably my #1 or #2 band.
They broke up for a while but are back together and making new music.
They even have a new album coming in April, I've heard!

# Wrapping Up

If you are on the hunt for new music and enjoy prog-rock, check out some of the tracks I linked.
Then, if you don't enjoy _any_ of them, no worries!
If you _do_ like them, however, then we should get a beer (coffee works, too).
