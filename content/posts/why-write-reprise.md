It’s over.
A blog post a week for all of 2024.
How’d it go? TBH, I’m super glad I did it but it never really got easier / more enjoyable.
Writing has always been a bit of a “pulling teeth” experience for me.
It definitely isn’t more-ish.
Nonetheless, it is a good skill to hone and showcase as part of my portfolio.
Being able to write technical content comes in very handy when doing professional software development.
