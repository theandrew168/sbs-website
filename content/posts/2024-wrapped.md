2024 was a year of great personal accomplishment: both personal and professional.
From new friends to new skills, a lot has changed and I've experience a lot of growth!
2024 was also the year of balance: balancing work, life, and the nuances within each.
Within work, I balanced regular development work with tech leading and planning.
Within life, I balanced relationships: welcoming new friends who all come with unique and exciting interests, experiences, and perspectives.

# Home Ownership

Personally, my wife and I bought a house!
We are home owners for the first time our lives and it has been amazing.
Sure, there is a lot of work to do, but overall it has been a tremendous benefit.
We both work from home and have separate offices now.
Our dog, Maple, has a big yard to run around it.
The ground-floor living room has no TV: just a bay window, plenty of seating, and our vinyl setup.
We jokingly refer to this as our "regen" living room.
Downstairs, we have a 2x3 arrangement of short floor couches (corgis have short legs) that puts us at the perfect height for TV-realted activities.
This is the "degen" living room.

# Technical Leadership

Professionally, I saw a lot of growth in 2024.
At work, I took my first dive into technical leadership: leading teams of 2-3 through multi-month software projects.
I learned techniques ([Mikado Method](https://mikadomethod.info/) and [Two Ways to Build a Pyramid](/posts/two-ways-to-build-a-pyramid/), for exmaple) for breaking down large, abstracts features into bite-sized, actionable tasks.
The biggest thing I learned is this: if the tickets are clear and correctly-sized, developers are able to complete them at a quick, consistent pace.
This, in turn, leads to increased team morale since everyone feels like they are crushing it (because they are)!
Selfishly, this reflects positively on my planning and leadership capabilities.
Since the year began, I've led three projects to successful, on-time completion.
The first few definitely caused me quite a bit of stress but things have gotten easier.

# Weekly Blogging

At the start of 2024, my buddy Nick and I set a goal for ourselves: write a blog post every week. I’m very hyped to say that I’ve made it! This is my final, 52nd post of the year. Some posts were good, some posts were… less good. But overall I think these writings will serve as a great additional to my portfolio as a professional developer. I (well, Bloggulus) got a very minimal shout out from Rachel by the Bay. That really made my week!

Was it fun? Sometimes. To be honest, writing these posts rarely felt “more-ish” to me. Rarely did I find myself super eager and excited to write a post (thought it did happen a few times). Initially, I put a lot of pressure on myself to make each post long, detailed, and objectively useful. I let some of that pressure go midway though the year, though. Instead, I let myself write about anything: what I did that week, opinions on non-technical subjects, and the occasional technical deep dive.

Now that I’m at the end, it feels nice to look back and reflect on everything I’ve written. Some posts fill me with joy to re-read while others fall a bit flat (they can’t all be winners). Here are some of my favorite posts from the past year.

# Other Projects

1. Add user accounts and personalization to Bloggulus
2. Completed all 25 days of Advent of Code
3. Wrote and published my first WoW addon
4. Turned 30 years old (still thriving)

# Looking Forward

What do I hope to achieve in 2025?
I still want to blog, but likely not every week.
I also plan on [writing more Clojure](/posts/2025-the-year-of-clojure/) which I'm super excited for!
I'm not sure if I'll do AoC again.
On December 25th, I always tell myself that it wasn't worth the stress and that I won't do it next year... but then I can't stay away.
It's the hype!
People at work are talking about it, friends are talking about it, and I _know_ that thousands of devs are having a great time with the early puzzles.
