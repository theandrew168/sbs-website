## Binders

I store my collection in identical, matte-black 4x3 binders made by [vaultx](https://us.vaultx.com/collections/card-binders/products/12-pocket-strap-binder).
They hold 120 rows of 4 cards (for a total of 480) per binder.
Since my collection is a "playset" collection, I keep 4 copies of each card (since that is the limit within a deck).
This means that each binder can hold up to 120 unique cards.
Thankfully, Digimon sets range in size from ~72 to ~115, with the average being around 102.
This means that 4 copies of every card in a set can fit into a single binder.

The binders are labeled by set and stored vertically (they get quite heavy so I store them _under_ a shelf).
I do want to print out some nicer labels someday.

## Alt Arts

I also have a second, nicer binder for storing alt-arts cards that overflow beyond my baseline 4 copies.
This binder came from the Premium Bandai [Beelzemon Binder Set](https://p-bandai.com/us/item/N2710855001001) and is quite well made.
The binder is no longer available for purchase from first-party, unfortunately, but you could probably find it from a [reseller](https://www.tcgplayer.com/product/514078/storage-albums-bandai-storage-albums-digimon-card-game-premium-binder-set-9-pocket-binder-beelzemon-and-beelstarmon?page=1&Language=English) for a slightly higher price.

## Sealed Product / Pre-orders

Bandai releases (on average) two main sets and one extra set per year.
I typically order two booster boxes of each set.
For the larger, "3 into 2" sets (Bandai has done this twice), I order three boxes of each.
Usually, I pre-order the boxes through [GameNerdz](https://www.gamenerdz.com/digimon) (they are a great distributor).
Sometimes, however, supply and demand cause GN to sellout before pre-order and even for weeks after.
In that case, I'll find a backup seller on TCGplayer and order my boxes there.

## Opening Packs

The first fun part!
Opening packs and slotting the cards into their respective binders.
I usually open 4-6 packs at a time, over the course of a few weeks (often during meetings).
I like spacing out the cracking process to give me something to look forward to.

## Tracking Missing Singles

Track missing singles in a spreadsheet.
I include the card info, quantity, market value, and total estimated cost to backfill.
Totals higher than $10 are yellow, higher than $50 are light red, and higher than $100 are dark red.

## Bulk Ordering / Cart Optimization

I order singles in batches from TCGplayer.
I try to optimize the card to minimize the number of packages and emphasize trusted sellers.
I wish the optimization process was more advanced (or if TCGplayer had an API so I could write one myself).
I like to avoid single-card orders even if it means paying slightly more from a seller that is already in my cart.

## Tracking Orders

Orders are tracked in another spreadsheet.
Placed but not shipped orders are red, shipped orders are yellow.

## Opening Mail / Verification / Feedback

The second fun part!
Mail day.
I grab the mail, check what cards were received, and compare them against my spreadsheet.

If something is amiss, I'll double check the TCGplayer order and see if I made a mistake in the order of if the seller made a mistake in what they sent.
Mistakes happen pretty rarely.
Some packages do get "lost in the mail", unfortunately.
When these mistakes happen, the cards that never arrived get moved back into the "single to buy" sheet and will be re-purchased in a future batch order.
For complete, on-time orders, I always leave positive feedback on TCGplayer.
I like to give credit to the responsible sellers!

## Conclusion

It's pretty crazy to see this whole process documented in one place.
I developed it organically over the course of a few years.
Despite the fuss, I like approaching a gacha-style TCG with dedicated processes to achieve completion.
Having a full playset of every set means that I'll always be able to build any deck.
Now I just need the game to become more popular since I'm pretty I'm the only person in my town who plays it.
