I’ve been thinking about Clojure a lot lately.
Something about the “lisp on the JVM” has always fascinated me… but it has never “clicked”.
I love its core ideas: immutable data, simple syntax, emphasis on pure functions, great interop with java, etc.
In fact, some of my recent design strategies for writing web apps in Go (link) are inching closer to functional design (HO funcs, etc).
I’d like to write more Clojure in 2025 and see if I can finally connect deeply with its philosophy.
Plus it can deploy as a single file (with embedded resources)!

Every talk I watch about Clojure fascinates me:

1. [Commander Pattern / CQRS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1-gS0oEtYc)
2. [Abstracting Data With Maps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sjb6y19YIWg)
3. [Everything Will Flow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bNOO3xxMc0)
4. [Transparency Through Data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zznwKCifC1A)
5. [Clojure Spec Data Constraints](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb0UhDeHzBM)
6. [Solving Problems the Clojure Way](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vK1DazRK_a0)
7. [11 Datomic Insights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSgTQzHYeLU)

Even the Clojure-adjacent databases are interesting:

2. [XTDB](https://xtdb.com/)

Also, 2024 was the “Year of Balance”.
It was about trying to appreciate nuance: the subtle grays between black and white.
There is always good and bad, perfection is rare.
I was chatting with a friend who was thinking about “ghost busting” and reaching out to old relationships that have fallen off with time.
Sometimes we get busy and sometimes we struggle.
In those times, some people pull back from connections and focus on themselves.
Once the storm passes, should you reach back out?
Perhaps 2025 is also the “Year of Closure” (pun intended).
