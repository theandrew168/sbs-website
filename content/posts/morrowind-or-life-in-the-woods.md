I’ve always thought that [Morrowind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Elder_Scrolls_III:_Morrowind) seems like an amazing game... but I’ve never truly played it.
I’ve tried to get into the setting, themes, and gameplay, but it could never hook me.
Am I too impatient?
Does the game give the player too much freedom and not enough direction?
It must be a “me” problem.
The game is critically acclaimed but I can’t seem to enjoy it: more importantly, I _want_ to enjoy it but haven't been able to.
If I had tried to play it when I was much younger, I'm sure it would've completely blown my mind.

What if I was stuck in a cabin in the woods for some number of months with only myself, nature, and an air-gapped computer with Morrowind installed (the essentials, right?).
Would I finally be able to enjoy it?
More so, would I completely immerse myself into the fantasy universe because, compared to the woods, it was an exciting adventure?
Or would I still, in this environment that has so little going on and moves so slowly, find the game uninteresting and boring?

Perhaps this is a dopamine problem.
I just finished reading [Dopamine Nation](https://www.annalembke.com/dopamine-nation) so this concept is fresh in my mind.
Are old, slow-burn games hard for me to get into because they aren’t as pretty / gripping / flashy as today’s games?
Could I enjoy this game at an isolated cabin because it would effectively be a forced dopamine reset?
When living in the woods, [Thoreau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walden) was able to find beauty in even the smallest of things.
I don’t know what the answer is, but I might have to start looking for a cabin.
